# BWCPS-Streams

This project is intended to provide a language for Stream modeling with respect to Edge- and Security-Analytics.

Following projects are provided or otherwise need to be generated within the EMF-platform:
- Model
> Domain-specific language based on EMF for modeling complete streams including the definition of containers, nodes, edges as well as operations for specific edge analytics and security measurements 
- Edit (to be generated by the user)
> Standard EMF-based edit-framework
- Editor (to be generated by the user)
> Standard EMF-based generated editors including tree representations

# What components are represented in the Stream-Model?

There are three packages in Stream model, two of them relevant and necessary for modeling the Edge-Architectures.

- Entities
- Operations
